        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <article>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is World Lotto Generator's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. For instance, when you submit a reaction or use our contact form. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.</p>
            <p>For our emoji reaction feature, we use Firebase Functions to anonymously count votes. To prevent duplicate votes, we associate a vote with the user's IP address. This IP address is stored in a secure, separate collection in our database for the sole purpose of preventing vote manipulation and is not used for any other purpose or shared with third parties.</p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.</p>

            <h2>3. Cookies</h2>
            <p>Our website may use cookies to enhance user experience. A cookie is a small file placed on your computer's hard drive. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>We may use third-party services such as Google AdSense. These services may collect information used to identify you. The privacy policy of these third-party services should be consulted for more information on their practices. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

            <h2>5. Links to Other Sites</h2>
            <p>Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.</p>

            <h2>6. Your Consent</h2>
